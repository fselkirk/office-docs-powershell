## NOTES

You will be prompted with [Principals[#]] to designate entities (one per line) that are allowed to associate sites they administer to the Hub site. When you are finished, respond to the current prompt by pressing the Enter key. If you do not provide any principals, any site administration may associate their site to the hub site. 

If the site doesn’t exist, this cmdlet returns a “File not found” error.

If the site is already a hub site, this cmdlet returns a "This site is already a HubSite" error.

If the site is already associated with another hub site, this cmdlet returns a "This site is currently associated with a HubSite" error. You'll need to run the [Remove-SPOHubSiteAssociation](Remove-SPOHubSiteAssociation.md) cmdlet first before you can make the site a hub site.
